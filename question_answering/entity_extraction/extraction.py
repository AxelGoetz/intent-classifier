    """
    Performs entity extraction.

    There are two main data structures, each with their own advantage that
    can be returned:
      1. A dictionary with as key the entity name, and as value an array of entity values.
        (e.g. {color: [green]}).
      2. An array with the same length as the input array. Each index of the array contains a list
        containing the entities that instance matched (e.g. ['I', 'am', 'Axel'] â†’ [['subject'], ['verb'], ['Name', 'adverb']).

    At the moment, we choose the first option but the code should not be too difficult to change.

    Parameters:
      - tokens: An array of strings/tokens (preferably not cleaned).

    Returns:
      - A dictionary in the format `{entity: [tokens]}`.
